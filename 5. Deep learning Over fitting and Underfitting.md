A model's capacity refers to the size and complexity of the patterns it is able to learn.

If your network is underfitting the data, you should try increasing its capacity.
You can increase the capacity of a network either by making it wider (more units to existing layers) or by making it deeper (adding more layers). 
Wider networks have an easier time learning more linear relationships, while deeper networks prefer more nonlinear ones.

```
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1),
])

wider = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1),
])

deeper = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1),
])
```
