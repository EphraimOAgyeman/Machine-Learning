# Welcome to deep learning

## Weights and Biases
* A weight is a number assigned to each neuron. A neural network "learns" by modifying its weights.
* The bias is a special kind of weight. It has no association with the inputs. The bias enables the neuron to modify the output independently of its inputs.

## Linear unit 
### (x * w) + b = y
### input * weight, all plus the bias equals output


## Multiple inputs unit
### (x * w) + (x * w) + (x * w) + b = y
### x0w0 + x1y1 + x2y2 + x3y3 + b = y

y is the x-axis coordinate for the activation function.

# Keras
## keras.Sequential
It is used to create a neural network as a stack of layers

## Creating a linear model accepting three inputs and producing a single output

```
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential([
  layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[3])
])
```

## Example two 
# Predicting quality of wine from physiochemical measurements

Import your data
```
import pandas as pd

red_wine = pd.read_csv('../input/dl-course-data/red-wine.csv')
red_wine.head()
```
Find the shape of your data
```
red_wine.shape # (rows, columns)
#(1599, 12)
```
Fill your input shape
```
input_shape = [11]
# ITs 11 because one column is used as the label column and the rest are the features columns
```

Look at the weights
```
w, b = model.weights
print("Weights\n{}\n\nBias\n{}".format(w, b))
```

## Activation function
An activation function is simply a function we apply to each of the layer's outputs.
1. Rectifier function - turns negatives to zero hence the word rectifier

## First neural network with activation funciton - relu

```
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential([
      layers.Dense(units=4, activation='relu', input_shape=[2]),
      layers.Dense(units=3, activation='relu'),
      layers.Dense(units=1)
])
```

# Predicting compressive strenght in concrete manufactured according to various recipes.
Importing dataset
```
import pandas as pd

concrete = pd.read_csv('../input/dl-course-data/concrete.csv')
concrete.head()
```

Finding our input shape
```
concrete.shape
input_shape = [8]
```

Define the model with hidden layers
```
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(units=512, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
    layers.Dense(units=512, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(units=512, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1)
    # when there is no other argument in the `layers.Dense` function, the number represents the unit or output
])
```

Creating models with separate activation function layers
```
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(32, input_shape=[8]),
    layers.Activation('relu'),
    layers.Dense(32),
    layers.Activation('relu'),
    layers.Dense(1),
])
```
## TO VISUALIZE THE NEURAL NETWORK, READ THE NUMBERS IN REVERSE


## In addition to the training data, we need two more things:

* Loss Functions - it tells how good the model actually is..
* Optimizer - It is what helps the model adjust its weight - It helps the model learn...
