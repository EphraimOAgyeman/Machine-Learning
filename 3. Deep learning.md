# Welcome to deep learning

## Weights and Biases
* A weight is a number assigned to each neuron. A neural network "learns" by modifying its weights.
* The bias is a special kind of weight. It has no association with the inputs. The bias enables the neuron to modify the output independently of its inputs.

## Linear unit 
### (x * w) + b = y
### input * weight, all plus the bias equals output


## Multiple inputs unit
### (x * w) + (x * w) + (x * w) + b = y
### x0w0 + x1y1 + x2y2 + x3y3 + b = y


# Keras
## keras.Sequential
It is used to create a neural network as a stack of layers

## Creating a linear model accepting three inputs and producing a single output

```
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential([
  layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[3])
])
```
