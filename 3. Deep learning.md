# Welcome to deep learning

## Weights and Biases
* A weight is a number assigned to each neuron. A neural network "learns" by modifying its weights.
* The bias is a special kind of weight. It has no association with the inputs. The bias enables the neuron to modify the output independently of its inputs.

## Linear unit 
### (x * w) + b = y
### input * weight, all plus the bias equals output
