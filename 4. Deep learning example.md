Eleven columns means eleven inputs.

We've chosen a three-layer network with over 1500 neurons. This network should be capable of learning fairly complex relationships in the data.

```
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(512, activation='relu', input_shape=[11]),
    layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1),
])
```


After defining the model, we compile in the optimizer and loss function.

```
model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='mae',
)
```

Now we're ready to start the training! We've told Keras to feed the optimizer 256 rows of the training data at a time (the batch_size) and to do that 10 times all the way through the dataset (the epochs).

```
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid),
    batch_size=256,
    epochs=10,
)
```


testing loss
```
import pandas as pd

# convert the training history to a dataframe
history_df = pd.DataFrame(history.history)
# use Pandas native plot method
history_df['loss'].plot();
```
